## Installation and Requirements
1. Download the `.zip file` and extract it at place of your choice
2. You'll be needing an <b>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</b>, I used VS Code Editor
3. For compiling the program, your IDE should must be setup with `Java 20.0.1 Version` and its supporting <b>compiler</b> and <b>extensions</b>
4. <b>MySQL</b> is being used as database, so for which your system should have a complete setup of <b>Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)</b>
5. For <b>JDBC</b>, I used `mysql-connector-j-8.3.0` which is a <b>Executable Jar File</b> for which you need to edit your <b>System Classpath</b>
6. You'll be requiring MySQL <b>User ID</b> and <b>Password</b>

## Usage
### Two commands will be needed 
1. For Compiling : `javac MoneyManager.java`
2. For Executing : `java MoneyManager`

## Features
1. <b>Secure Authentication</b>: Implements a robust login and registration system to ensure secure access to the application, with password encryption and validation mechanisms
2. <b>Transaction Management</b>: Enables users to perform debit and credit transactions seamlessly, providing real-time balance updates and detailed transaction histories
3. <b>Flexible Account Management</b>: Offers functionalities such as balance enquiry, mini statement generation, password change, and account deletion, providing users with full control over their finance accounts

## Contributing
You can contribute to my code in following ways :
1. When a user deletes their Account, Impliment an approach by which the data of the deleted user still reamins intact with our database for future usage
2. You can re-structure the database relation to achive higher <b>Normalisation Form</b>, You can also include the concept of <b>Forgein Keys</b> in the database
3. Since many buttons in UI are desinged in a same particular manner for which same statements are written multiple times, an <b>Algorithm</b> can be implemented which returns the object of `JButton` with a particular styling, leading the code to be more <b>optimised</b> and <b>readable</b>
